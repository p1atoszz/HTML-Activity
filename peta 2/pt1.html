<h1>The Lion and the Poor Slave</h1>
<h2>Aesop</h2>
<p>
<font color="violet" size="14px"><b>A kind
slave</b></font> ran away from his cruel
master and hid in the
<font color="green"
size="14px"><u>forest</u></font>
There, he saw a <font color="violet"
size="14px"><b>lion</b></font>
<font color="red" size="14px"><sup>roaring
in pain because a big thorn was stuck in its
paw.</sup></font>
Even though he was scared, the slave helped
the lion by pulling the thorn out.
The lion went back into <font color="green"
size="14px"><u>the woods</u></font>, free
and happy.
</p>
<p>
Later, <font color="red"
size="14px"><sup>the slave was caught and
sent to be punished by being
thrown</sup></font> into a
<font color="green" size="14px"><u>lion’s
den</u></font>.
But <font color="blue" size="14px"><sub>the
lion didn’t harm him—it was the same lion he
had helped!</sub></font>
</p>

<font color="yellow" size="14px"><em>
Moral of the story: A good deed is never
forgotten.
Be kind, and kindness will come back to you.
